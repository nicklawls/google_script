# Google Apps Script Time Management

This repo contains my initial experiments with a google spreadsheet that would assist me in tracking and managing my time. I have had some modest success and am using a version of it today, allthough in a far smaller capacity than I initially hoped. I use google apps script and available API's to access my google calendars and tasks, and then process this information as needed. Hopefully I'll be able to make something functional and deployable at some point
